# Illusion v1.0

## Introduction

_Illusion: Mobile Application for Differently Abled_ was developed as part of the Mini Project course under Kerala Technological University. The inspiration behind taking up this particular topic was after researching about the problems faced by the blind people in our country. Our aim was to build a mobile application for a social cause. Hence, the idea of _Illusion_ was formulated.

## Product
The product is a culmination of various ideas. It is an all-in-one app that targets the differently-abled individuals. The primary users of _Illusion_ are categorised into three:
1. Visually-impaired users
2. Speechless users
3. Hearing-impaired users

## How to use

Home-page acts as the common page from which the user directs the control to any other tab. The home-page takes the user to four different tabs namely: See, Listen, Speak and Settings.

See tab helps in detecting objects at a particular distance and warn the user about it. This feature mainly helps the blind users. It allows them to detect objects within a certain parameter.
There is also a voice assistant feature that is kept ON by default when the user opens the application for the first time. It works on the basis of a few commands to navigate between the tabs.

Listen tab is used to convert English speech to text. The conversion works for English language and thus English words or sounds are converted to text.

Speak tab is used for text to speech conversion. The English language is used for conversation. This feature mainly targets to help the mute population.

This project helped us to develop a spirit of teamwork and work towards the well-being of the society. It made us understand the problems faced by the differently abled population and the need to empower them by making them independent and self-confident.
